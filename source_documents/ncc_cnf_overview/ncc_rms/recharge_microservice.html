        <p class="p">NCC provides a capability to apply top-ups to the subscriber account balance. The
            recharge microservice allows handling the normal and voucher-based recharge and
            interacting with the RMS system. NCC also supports other profile-based recharge without
            interaction with RMS.</p>

        <div class="p">The recharge microservice contains these data model entities:<ul class="ul" id="recharge_microservice__ul_sh1_lpt_dsb">
                <li class="li">Recharge profile (Recharge offers)</li>

                <li class="li">Recharge RSV (rules)</li>

            </ul>
</div>

        <div class="p">Note these important points:<ul class="ul" id="recharge_microservice__ul_wzc_xkm_dsb">
                <li class="li">The voucher-based recharge top-up is only on the main account balance and not on
                    bucket of any type (monetary or non-monetary).</li>

                <li class="li">The voucher-based recharge top-up provides only a new subscription (bundle), but
                    does not update any existing bundle or extend the subscription of the device.
                    There is 1-1 mapping between Device and Account. </li>

                <li class="li">If the voucher-based top-up request API contains both recharge profile and
                    voucher card pin, then NCC RM gives preference to the voucher pin for
                    interaction with RMS. </li>

                <li class="li">One account should be linked to only one device. Do not link different devices
                    to the same account through purchased subscriptions.</li>

                <li class="li">To successfully add a bundle in a top-up, the bundle definition must be already
                    created in NCC. The fee (in the bundle definition is 0) or any chargeFee related
                    to that bundle is also zero.</li>

                <li class="li">A successful top-up performed at NCC extends the number of days based on the end
                    of validity date and not on the top-up date.</li>

                <li class="li">The validity extension is in number of days, that is, exact days as configured
                    in the Recharge profile and not exact days+end of day. </li>

                <li class="li">Group related use cases are not considered. </li>

                <li class="li">Tax related requirement and use case related to top-up are not considered.</li>

                <li class="li">Bonus recharge and bonus related notifications are not considered.</li>

                <li class="li">Notifications can be sent to subscribers on successful top-up and failure cases. </li>

                <li class="li">The detailed response message and code is sent as a response to the top-up
                    request.</li>

                <li class="li">Subscribers cannot exceed a maximum balance level. The recharge request that
                    exceeds the maximum level gets rejected with EDR and notification.</li>

                <li class="li">For a successful recharge, the account lifecycle state changes from Pre-Active
                    to Active.</li>

                <li class="li">The SM subsystem does not generate any EDR or notification if pre-verification
                    checks are done before triggering RM or internal error at SM.</li>

                <li class="li">EDRs get generated with detailed information about recharge performed in case of
                    success or failure, creation or deletion of recharge profile.</li>

                <li class="li">Alarms get generated in case of error case between RMS and recharge
                    microservice.</li>

                <li class="li">Overage limit and other specific use cases for prepaid, postpaid, and hybrid
                    customers (or related account balance) are not considered.</li>

            </ul>
