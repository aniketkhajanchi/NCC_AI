<div class="body conbody">
        <div class="p">The NCC architecture includes a few primary subsystems that can be included by themselves
            or with other subsystems in an NCC system. These subsystems are: <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">Service Manager (SM) - provides the GUI and provisioning interfaces in NCC. SM
                    subsystem also serves as the API GW for NCC interfaces used by external systems.
                    The SM subsystems in an NCC network deployment run in an active/active
                    geographically diverse environment, with remote data replication between the SM
                    subsystems. SM subsystem provisions and is aware of the location of all
                    subscriber or device records in the various NCC ME subsystems in a network
                    deployment. The SM subsystem contains the subscriber location data, but not the
                    actual subscriber records. <div class="note"><div class="notetitle"><img src="../../web/css/../images/note.svg" title="note-icon" class="noteicon" />Note:</div> While SM subsystem provides active/active
                        operation with data replication between the two SMs subsystems, Nokia
                        recommends that back-to-back transactions for the same subscriber/device or
                        set of devices within a particular group are all sent to the same IG system
                        to avoid race conditions with data replication.</div>
</li>

                <li class="li">Managed Element (ME) - provides the charging business logic and hosts the
                    subscriber data model, including the dynamic data updated as a result of
                    charging transactions. The ME subsystem produces charging data records (CDRs) to
                    record the details of all transactions.</li>

                <li class="li">SS7 - provides the SS7 connectivity and related special process. This subsystem
                    is typically deployed in an IG system.</li>

            </ul>

        </div>

        <div class="p">The NCC architecture includes a few types of systems, which include one or more
            subsystems: <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">IG System - This is an Integrated system that includes both the SM and ME
                    subsystems.</li>

                <li class="li">ME System - This system includes the ME subsystem only. Some network
                    deployments, for example, may have a pair of IG systems and some additional
                    pairs of ME systems.</li>

                <li class="li">EOC System - This is a type of ME system that includes the End-Of-Charging
                    application.</li>

                <li class="li">SM System - This system includes the SM subsystem only. This system type is not
                    generally available, since the IG system type provides a smaller network
                    deployment footprint that most customers prefer.</li>

            </ul>
