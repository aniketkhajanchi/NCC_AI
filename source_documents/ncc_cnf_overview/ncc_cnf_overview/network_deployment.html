        <p class="p">The entire solution that is deployed across multiple sites is called the network
            deployment.</p>

        <p class="p">A typical NCC network deployment has one pair of SM subsystems and one or more pairs of
            ME subsystems. Physically, this is deployed as a pair of IG systems, which include both
            the SM and the ME subsystems. Additional pairs of ME subsystems may be deployed for
            purposes of regionalization or additional capacity as standalone ME systems (not part of
            an IG).</p>

        <div class="section" id="network_deployment__section_xzs_1bb_llb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">SM subsystem deployment</h2>
            
            <div class="p">An NCC network deployment always includes a pair of IG systems, which each include an
                SM subsystem. The IG systems are typically deployed in geographically diverse
                locations to maximize resiliency. SM subsystems are active / active, with data
                replication between them. <div class="note"><div class="notetitle"><img src="../../web/css/../images/note.svg" title="note-icon" class="noteicon" />Note:</div> For back-to-back transactions for a given device,
                    group, or account, it is recommended to send those all to the same SM subsystem
                    in order to avoid race conditions.</div>

        <div class="section" id="network_deployment__section_u1l_wq5_klb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">ME subsystem deployment</h2>
            
            <p class="p">An NCC network deployment always includes a pair of IG systems, which each include an
                ME subsystem. The IG systems are typically deployed in geographically diverse
                locations to maximize resiliency. ME subsystems are active / active, with data
                replication between them. A subset of subscribers or devices is primary on one ME
                subsystem and secondary on the other in the pair, and the remaining subset is
                secondary on one ME subsystem and primary on the other.</p>

            <p class="p">Additional pairs of ME subsystems can be deployed in standalone ME systems as
                required for additional network capacity.</p>

        <div class="section" id="network_deployment__section_inc_cny_54b"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Additional ME subsystem deployment options</h2>
            
            <p class="p">The ME subsystem pairs can be deployed with two routing options:</p>

            <ul class="ul" id="network_deployment__ul_dw4_1ny_54b">
                <li class="li">Independent ME subsystem pairs <p class="p">In this model, each ME subsystem pair is
                    independent from the other pairs. Received traffic is either processed
                    locally or site-routed to the other ME subsystem in the pair (or is
                    rejected). There is no NCC site routing to an ME subsystem outside of this
                    pair. The operator's network must perform routing to ensure that a
                    particular message arrives to the correct ME subsystem pair, if that is
                    required.</p>

                </li>

                <li class="li">Networked ME subsystem pairs<p class="p"> In this model, all ME subsystems can communicate
                    with each other and know which subscribers are homed on any of the ME
                    subsystems in the network. When a message arrives at an ME subsystem, if the
                    subscriber is not homed on this local ME subsystem, then this ME subsystem
                    can site-route this message to the home ME subsystem anywhere in the
                    network, not limited to just the other ME subsystem in this pair.</p>

                </li>
