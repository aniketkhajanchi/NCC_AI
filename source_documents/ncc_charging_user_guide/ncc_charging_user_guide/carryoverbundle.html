<p class="p">This feature introduces the capability to carry over parts of a recurring bundle when a subscription is either renewed or reset for the next billing cycle. For example, consider a monthly recurring bundle consisting of voice minutes, SMS, and data. The voice minutes are configured to carry over in the monthly bundle. At the end of the bundle period, the monthly bundle is renewed and balance for SMS and data services are reset. The balance for voice minutes is also reset and available for use along with the pre-renewal balance.</p>

<p class="p">The carried over balance is made available to an end user following either of the given scenarios:</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">
<p class="p">In the first case, the carried over balance is made available only for one billing cycle. At the end of each billing cycle, the carried over balance is overwritten, which means that the last unused carried over balance is lost.</p>

</li>

<li class="li">
<p class="p">In the second case, the carried over balance does not expire. At the end of each billing cycle, the new carried over balance is added to the existing carried over balance. You can configure the maximum value of the amount that is carried over from the main bucket over the reset or renew billing cycle. If any limit is defined for the carried over amount, then the final balance is capped to that limit.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<div class="body conbody">
            <div class="section">
                <p class="p">If the carry-over feature is configured, then either the initial value of the
                    main bucket balance or the combined value of the main bucket balance and carried
                    over bucket balance is used to calculate the threshold level. The
                        <em class="ph i">ThresholdNotificationType</em> application preference is considered only
                    when threshold is configured in percentage. For more information refer <a class="xref" href="#concept_vjz_gbl_r4b__ex3">Example 3: Threshold notification is triggered when the total of remaining bucket balance and carry-over balance exceeds the defined limit</a> and <a class="xref" href="#concept_vjz_gbl_r4b__ext4">Example 4: Total of remaining bucket balance and carry-over balance triggers a low-level threshold notification</a>.</p>

                <p class="p">The carry over feature impacts the calculation of dynamic slicing as well. The
                    combined value of the main bucket balance and carried over balance is considered
                    for dynamic slicing calculation. For information on dynamic slicing
                    functionality, see the <a class="xref" href="dynamic.html">Dynamic slicing</a> section.</p>
