        <p class="p">Without slice reduction, threshold is not considered during reservation, which result in
            delay in triggering the associated rule actions and produced incorrect behavior. For
            example, if a threshold level is configured to send a notification to the user once the
            data usage reaches 80% of the account balance, then the notification was sent only at
            commit despite of the reservation logic realizing that the threshold level is crossing
            80% at the time of reservation. In this case, the actions associated with the threshold
            level led to inaccurate results as logic took the decision at commit and by that time,
            the current usage already crossed the defined threshold value by a significant gap.
            Therefore, to reduce this gap, the slice reduction feature was introduced to make the
            actions associated with the threshold value more accurate.</p>

        <p class="p">Slice reduction checks the upcoming threshold values defined for a (main or carry-over)
            bucket, counter, account balance, or Aggregate View (AV) and its associated actions,
            such as <samp class="ph systemoutput">Notification</samp>,
                <samp class="ph systemoutput">Notification-Stop</samp>,
                <samp class="ph systemoutput">Notification-Reject</samp>,
                <samp class="ph systemoutput">Send-SNR</samp>, or <samp class="ph systemoutput">Send-RAR</samp> at
            the time of reservation. With slice reduction, when the current usage approaches the
            upcoming threshold values, the slice size is reduced in such a way that the result of
            actions become more accurate for the defined threshold values.</p>

        <p class="p">This feature is applicable to both centralized and decentralized charging calls and
            performed for all defined threshold actions.</p>

        <div class="note notice"><div class="noticetitle"><img src="../../web/css/../images/notice.svg" title="notice-icon" class="noteicon" />Notice:</div> It is recommended not to use the slice reduction feature with
                <em class="ph i">DYNAMIC_ALGO</em> or <em class="ph i">DYNAMIC_ALGO_2</em> because the slice reduction logic is
            itself an algorithm, which reduces the slice size depending on the upcoming threshold
            values. However, if the slice reduction logic and <em class="ph i">DYNAMIC_ALGO</em> or
                <em class="ph i">DYNAMIC_ALGO_2</em> are configured together, then the feature behavior might
            change and this may lead to unexpected results.</div>
