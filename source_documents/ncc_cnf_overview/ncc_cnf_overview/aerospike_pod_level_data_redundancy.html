<div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p">Aerospike pods store two copies of each piece of data, split across two pods in opposite
         logical racks. Aerospike monitors its own pods and in one to two seconds, detects a failed
         pod and reconfigures the cluster to promote the replica for each DB partition on a failed
         pod. Failure recovery continues with Aerospike migrating a second copy of the impacted
         records to other pods, such that two copies are again present in the system even though
         some database pods are now failed. Before Aerospike cluster reconfiguration, application DB
         requests return an error to the application and the application returns an error to the
         peer or client.</p>

      <p class="p">Aerospike can be configured with one or two spare pods per rack. With one spare per rack, a
         second pod failure in the same rack causes the service to be marked as failed, and the site
         to go down. With two spare pods per rack, a second pod can fail with the system remaining
         healthy, but a third failure marks the service down, and therefore the site down.</p>

      <p class="p">If two DB pods fail in the same rack, this is tolerated because the second copy of those
         records in the other rack is still available. If a node in one rack fails soon after a node
         in the other rack has failed, before the data migration of impacted records has completed
         (may take several minutes), the database service is considered out-of-service. This is
         because there are a portion of records (having their two copies on the two failed pods)
         which would now be unavailable.</p>
