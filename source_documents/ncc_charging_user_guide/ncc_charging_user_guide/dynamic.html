<p class="p">Dynamic slicing allows the operators to organize the networks to efficiently address different use cases. It also allow the operators to design, deploy, customize, optimize the network slices running in the network, and dynamically allocate network resources that can maximize customer value; thus, increasing revenue opportunities. Operators can distribute the network slices quickly on demand. These slices can support the 5G’s network requirements for bandwidth, throughput, latency, and availability that provides opportunities for use cases such as IoT, smart cities. </p>

<p class="p">In NCC, for dynamic slicing, the dynamic quota algorithm provides a mechanism to allocate the
                right quota size for a reasonable amount of time. This approach avoids blocking of
                quota for sessions not using it. </p>

<p class="p">For centralized charging, when the call controller receives a network request with an empty RSU from the Packet Data Gateway (PGW), then depending on the different parameters specified in the charging system such as resources, different RAT type, heavy user, light user, medium group, large group, the slice size is computed accordingly. The quota allocation can be provided to both group and individual resources of prepaid or postpaid accounts. Both static and dynamic quota allocation can be provided based on the customer network. </p>

<p class="p">The different quota allocation algorithms are available such as <em class="ph i">BASIC_ALGO</em>,
                    <em class="ph i">BUCKET_ALGO</em>, <em class="ph i">DYNAMIC_ALGO</em>, or <em class="ph i">DYNAMIC_ALGO_2</em>. See <a class="xref" href="#dsv">Dynamic slicing algorithm configuration and variants</a> for different variants available in NCC. </p>

                <p class="p">This is the basic default configuration that is easy to use and covers most
                    common cases. In case of centralized charging, rules are defined to calculate
                    the exact value to be used in the dynamic quota management (slicing profile) and
                    these rules contain algorithms that calculate the dynamic quota slice. </p>

                <p class="p">The rules defined in the quota management (slicing profile) entity
                    provide flexibility to configure the dynamic slicing parameter based on
                    different configuration. The quota management (slicing profile) entity
                    is not created at the time of NCC installation and has to be configured. The
                    default quota management (slicing profile) name must be created with
                    dynamic profile name configured in the application preference <strong class="ph b">Default Dynamic
                        slicing profile</strong>. You can modify the application preference and change
                    the default name <var class="keyword varname">default_profile</var> to a new name.</p>

                <p class="p">Rules defined in the quota management (slicing profile) have the highest
                    priority. They are checked one-by-one and the first rule to satisfy the
                    condition is picked up for processing. These inputs are available in the Dynamic
                    Slice context in the quota management (Slicing profile) entity.</p>

                <p class="p">Rules define the slice based on the applicability condition and context. The
                    rules in dynamic quota management (slicing profile) contain the dynamic
                    slicing algorithm configured to calculate the dynamic slice size or dynamic
                    network parameters, such as Validity Time (VT) or Quota Holding Time (QHT). The
                    applicability condition may use Radio Access Type (RAT) and device ID derived
                    from AVPs. For example, we can either have a slicing algorithm or a rule for 2G
                    smart phones and IoT devices, 3G smart phones and IoT devices, and 4G smart
                    phones and IoT devices. The context can be source context, bucket context, group
                    context, device context, and session context.</p>

                <div class="note"><div class="notetitle"><img src="../../web/css/../images/note.svg" title="note-icon" class="noteicon" />Note:</div> VT defines the time for which the dynamic quota remains active in the
                        network, thus controlling the effective allocation of resources. QHT defines
                        the time for which the call session remains in the idle state. Once QHT
                        expires, the network reports back the usage and gets a new dynamic quota
                        allocated.</div>
