<div class="body">
<p class="p">The Overage Limit (OLI) is the ability to define an overage usage limit per counter within a bundle and it is applicable only when the usage limit is set and reached. Once, the ULI of a counter is reached, the OLI is considered and it is applied repeatedly.</p>

<p class="p">The Near-OLI are defined as the near-limit thresholds, which are configured as a percentage of the overage limit on a counter.</p>

<p class="p">The overage limit is set as per the bundle or charging service with the ability to trigger notifications or other actions when these limits are reached.</p>

<div class="note"><div class="notetitle"><img src="../../web/css/../images/note.svg" title="note-icon" class="noteicon" />Note:</div> The <samp class="ph systemoutput">Send-SNR</samp> action is configured for overage thresholds, which sends an SNR notification only once when the overage limit is reached (as administered by the Sy interface).</div>

<p class="p">For example, if the overage limit is defined as 2 GB for a counter and <samp class="ph systemoutput">Send-SNR</samp> action is configured on 100% of 2 GB in the overage threshold, then an SNR is sent when the overage limit is reached for the first time. After that, the Sy interface administers to not send the SNR for the same signaling state in case it is same as the last successfully sent SNR state.</p>
