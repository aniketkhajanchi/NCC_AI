        <p class="p">CG Distributor Node is used for distributing CDR files to a local or remote directory.
            The directory is created automatically if it does not already exist when a file is
            distributed to that location.</p>

        <p class="p">CG Distributor Node first distributes the file with a temporary suffix, so it can be
            distinguished from completely distributed files. The temporary suffix points to the
            corresponding batch in the database.</p>

        <p class="p">Once the file has been fully stored in the target location, CG Distributor Node verifies
            that the batch is still in the database. If the batch has been removed from the
            database, it means that it must have been distributed by some other File output stream
            in the meantime. In that case, the distributor removes the distributed file with the
            temporary suffix from the target location. If, on the other hand, the batch is still in
            the database when the output file has been fully sent to the target location, the
            distributor removes the temporary suffix from the sent file, marking it as fully
            distributed, removes the batch and its output records from the database and releases the
            batch processing lock.</p>

        <p class="p">The CDR files can be stored either as they are or in compressed format on the target
            host. For more information, see the <cite class="cite">Operation, Administration and Maintenance
                Guide</cite> in the NCC documentation set.</p>
