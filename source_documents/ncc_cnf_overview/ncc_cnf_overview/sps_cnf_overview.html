        <p class="p">NCC is a cloud-native software solution based on Kubernetes principles and offers
            significant benefits for service providers including software support for 5G, 4G along
            with SS7 support for legacy voice, SMS, IVR, and USSD traffic.</p>

        <div class="section" id="sps_cnf_overview__section_jvh_b25_klb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Characteristics of cloud-native NCC</h2>
            
            <p class="p">These are the key feature highlights of NCC.</p>

            <ul class="ul" id="sps_cnf_overview__ul_dcl_nvy_jlb">
                <li class="li">Cloud-native application<ul class="ul" id="sps_cnf_overview__ul_kbd_vb5_klb">
                        <li class="li">Infrastructure built around Kubernetes principles <p class="p">NCC uses Docker,
                                containers, Helm charts, and more.</p>
</li>

                        <li class="li">Packaged as lightweight containers <p class="p">Cloud-native applications are a
                                collection of independent and autonomous services, which are
                                packaged as lightweight containers. Unlike virtual machines,
                                containers scale out and scale in rapidly. Since the unit of scaling
                                is a lightweight container, infrastructure utilization is
                                optimized.</p>
</li>

                        <li class="li">Dynamic horizontal scaling<p class="p">The number of container instances grows and
                                shrinks as needed for handling the varying load. This enables NCC to
                                consume a much lower footprint during typical operating conditions,
                                where the offered traffic is less than the maximum peak dimensioned
                                and when the mate NCC system is healthy and processing its own share
                                of traffic. A load balancer runs L7 protocols that allows NCC to
                                distribute traffic across the container instances on a
                                request-by-request basis.</p>
</li>

                        <li class="li">Internal protocols are service mesh friendly <p class="p">Service meshes are
                                powerful tools that add power and flexibility to cloud-native
                                applications. NCC uses Istio that helps provide load balancing,
                                transparent mutual TLS authentication, distributed API call tracing,
                                and more.</p>
</li>

                        <li class="li">Designed as loosely coupled microservices <p class="p">Microservice design allows
                                for breaking up an application into a series of smaller, more
                                specialized parts, each of which communicates with one another
                                across common interfaces such as APIs and REST interfaces like HTTP.
                                A microservice might be provided by a collection of pods working
                                together to provide a service. Services that belong to the same
                                application discover each other through the application runtime, and
                                they exist independent of other services. Microservice design allows
                                for an elastic infrastructure that scales out with efficiency and
                                high performance.</p>
</li>

                        <li class="li">Consistent with the evolution towards agile DevOps processes <p class="p">Each
                                service of a cloud-native application goes through an independent
                                life cycle, which is managed through an agile DevOps process.
                                Multiple continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines work
                                in tandem to deploy and manage a cloud-native application.</p>
</li>

                    </ul>
</li>

                <li class="li">5G readiness<p class="p">NCC is a low-latency application built for 4G and 5G.</p>
</li>

                <li class="li">Legacy SS7 support<p class="p">NCC support legacy voice, SMS, IVR, and USSD over
                    SS7.</p>
</li>

                <li class="li">Agility and efficiency<p class="p">The flexibility provided by the Nokia Agile Rule
                        Technology (ART) delivers performance efficiency for highly complex
                        real-time use cases.</p>
</li>

                <li class="li">Use of best-in-class industry standard tools<p class="p">NCC supports the best-in-class
                        industry standard tools such as Jaeger, Prometheus, Kafka, OpenSearch,
                        Kiali, Istio, a metrics viewer, and more.</p>
</li>

                <li class="li">Flexible deployment options<p class="p">NCC supports deployment into a variety of customer
                        environments. NCC follows standard best practices and is therefore generic
                        and flexible by nature and suitable for integrating into many varied
                        deployment environments. In some cases, the customer environment (whether
                        their own or in a public cloud) may provide all the Kubernetes, load
                        balancers, Istio, telemetry, and other infrastructure. In other cases, the
                        customer may provide a more basic Kubernetes environment and rely on NCC to
                        provide the service mesh and telemetry.</p>

                </li>

                <li class="li">Subscriber model<p class="p">The NCC subscriber model provides flexibility in configuring
                        and managing all of the data associated with end-users and their devices,
                        subscriptions, usage, and accounts.</p>

                </li>

                <li class="li">Focus on groups<p class="p">NCC incorporates a group theme, such as family, large
                        enterprise groups, or ad-hoc groups based on rule-based quota allocation
                        algorithms on the Gy interface. The groups are formed for a short period of
                        time to either share a new subscription or share remaining resources on the
                        same account.</p>

                </li>

                <li class="li"> In-service updates <p class="p">NCC supports in-service software updates leveraging the
                        standard Kubernetes rolling update mechanism. NCC continues servicing
                        traffic while pods are updated one-at-a-time and brought back into service.
