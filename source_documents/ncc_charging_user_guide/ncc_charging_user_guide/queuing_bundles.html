<div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">As per the current NCC logic, a bundle attached to a Device can have multiple number of
            instances. When a bundle is attached to a Device, its instance (subscription) is created
            in Active state by default. This may be different if a bundle's lifecycle is modified to
            have a different behavior such as Future Activation Date. The bundle instances are used
            based on their priority defined at charging service level. Hence, the resources with
            higher priority are used first. </p>

        <p class="p">With the queuing bundles feature, operators can define a queue structure for bundle
            instances. The instances in a queue follow the queue property, that is, the first bundle
            instance in the queue will be used first. Once this instance is used up, then the next
            instance in the queue is used with validity starting from its first usage. </p>

        <p class="p">When the queued bundle is attached to a Device, the first subscription will be active and
            rest will be in inactive state per queue. This depends on the configuration of lifecycle
            attached to the bundle.</p>

        <p class="p">The bundle instances queue has the following properties:</p>

        <ul class="ul" id="queuing_bundles__ul_rq2_xnb_v4b">
            <li class="li">The instances can belong to different bundles.</li>

            <li class="li">The instances can have different priorities.</li>

            <li class="li">The instances can only be non-renewable. That is, do not add a bundle instance
                having BCR into the queue. </li>

            <li class="li">The instances are queued in the order of their creation time.</li>

            <li class="li">The number of instances in the queue can be controlled by configuration.</li>

            <li class="li">Only the active instance has a validity period.</li>

            <li class="li">Only the same type of bundle instances are allowed in the queue. For each instance,
                the bundle structure and definition are same other than the allowance (bucket size
                and validity period).</li>

        </ul>

        <p class="p">Note the following important points:</p>

        <ul class="ul" id="queuing_bundles__ul_xfj_x4b_v4b">
            <li class="li">Operators must define the same queue id for same bundle types. </li>

            <li class="li">Queuing bundle is supported for Device only.</li>

            <li class="li">Queuing bundle must be non-periodic/non-renewable.</li>

            <li class="li">Do not change the queuing definition of a bundle. If queue id is changed, then it
                may have adverse effect.</li>

            <li class="li">Composite bundles are not considered for queuing bundle feature. Here, composite
                indicates bundle having resources of different type such as bundle with voice and
                data resources. </li>

            <li class="li">Bundle On Use (BOU) bundles are not considered for queuing bundle feature.</li>

            <li class="li">Change Plan is not applicable for queuing bundle feature.</li>

            <li class="li">The bundle in the queue cannot have a step bucket.</li>

            <li class="li">One queued bundle will have one bucket. If more than one bucket is needed, then the
                exhaustion criteria can be configured through threshold rules. </li>

        </ul>
