<div class="body conbody">
        <div class="p">NCC includes SS7 capabilities for handling calls that are triggered from SS7 networks.
            NCC SS7 complements NCC by receiving requests from legacy SS7 Core Network elements and
            delivers them to NCC over Ro interface or over REST Interface. NCC SS7 enables NCC to perform:<ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">charging for voice calls and SMS requests that are received from legacy SS7
                    networks, and</li>

                <li class="li">provides responses to IVR and USSD self-care inquiries/updates that are received
                    from legacy SS7 networks.</li>

            </ul>
 This solution is composed of multiple internal modules. NCC SS7 must be installed
            in the namespace of either ME system or IG system.</div>

        <p class="p">This figure shows the NCC global service architecture.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">NCC SS7 architecture component descriptions</h2>
            
            <p class="p">This section describes each component of the NCC SS7 architecture.</p>

            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">Real-Time Call Control (RTCC) <p class="p">Core services are responsible for protocol such
                        as CAPv1/v2/v3, INCS1, NOKIA CS1+ and call type identification such as
                        Mobile Origination, Mobile Termination, Mobile Forwarding and IVR/Self-Care
                        calls, along with call handling as per the configuration of the respective
                        call scenarios both online and offline.</p>

                    <p class="p">The RTCC service performs call processing on received input parameters from
                        the network and initiates the charging triggers towards other NCC components
                        via the Diameter handler (DH) module. For calls that are allowed by NCC, the
                        RTCC service supervises the calls and charging update message transactions
                        towards the network and other NCC components.</p>

                    <p class="p">This module also performs the required orchestration to interact with the HLR
                        (Core Network Element) for the scenario of location information inquiry and
                        Mobile Number portability query (MNP Q).</p>

                </li>

                <li class="li">Diameter Handler (DH) <p class="p">This Module provides the actual Ro interface that is
                        used to interface with other NCC components.. The DH interface is complaint
                        to RFC <a class="xref" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6733" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">6733</a>.</p>

                    <p class="p">This module acts as a bridge between the RTCC and NCC. The module is capable
                        of handling requests from RTCC and then responding back to Core Network
                        services via RTCC over the SS7 interface. This module communicates with NCC
                        via the Ro interface on Diameter protocol. It is a Diameter Handler Object
                        which actually maps to the SS7 message parameter to the individual diameter
                        AVPs as per the agreed specification.</p>

                    <p class="p">This module establishes a connection with other NCC components as per
                        configuration by sending CER/CEA messages as soon as the module is up and
                        running.</p>

                </li>

                <li class="li">Service Data Point (SDP) <div class="p">This module is used for these two call features: <ul class="ul">
                            <li class="li">Home Re-Routing and</li>

                            <li class="li">Free Diversion to Voice Mail (FDTVM).</li>

                        </ul>
</div>

                    <p class="p">SDP modules store the data (such as Called/Calling/Forwarded Number, NOA,
                        IMSI, Service Key, MSC/VLR Address, etc.) that is received from the network
                        only when the two features are enabled and their respective configurations
                        match the call scenario.</p>

                </li>

                <li class="li">Unrestricted Supplementary Service Data Gateway (USSDGW) <div class="p">This module is
                        responsible for USSD call handling. USSDGW supports MAP1, MAP2, and MAP3
                        protocols. These two types of USSD requests are handled by this service: <ul class="ul">
                            <li class="li">USSD notifications that are initiated by NCC to be delivered to the
                                recipient over legacy 2G networks, and</li>

                            <li class="li">subscriber-initiated requests.</li>

                        </ul>

                    </div>

                    <p class="p">For subscriber-initiated requests, USSD requests are validated and processed.
                        For valid requests as per the USSD code, an interaction with other NCC
                        components takes place on the REST interface. This interaction is done
                        through the APIGW service. USSD-GW processes the response received from
                        other NCC components and relays that information to the subscriber as a USSD
                        message via HLR.</p>

                    <p class="p">For USSD Notifications (initiated by NCC), this module supports delivery of
                        USSD notifications to the end user via HLR. These notifications are
                        initiated by the NCC module over the REST interface, through APIGW, and then
                        the response from HLR is communicated to that NCC component.</p>

                </li>

                <li class="li">Application Programming Interface Gateway (APIGW) <p class="p">This module uses the REST
                        interface to interact with other NCC modules. APIGW acts as a bridge between
                        RTCC and NCC for IVR calls (for one part of IVR call flow) and USSDGW and
                        NCC for USSD self-care calls. All of the request/responses over REST are
                        communicated through this module with the CORE services.</p>

                </li>

                <li class="li">HLR <p class="p">The MAP interface is supported between RTCC/USSD-HLR. RTCC can query HLR
                        for location information/Number portability when this information is not
                        present in the incoming voice call trigger to RTCC. RTCC also queries HLR
                        for MAP ATI (Any Time interrogation) to get the location information and
                        number portability.</p>

                </li>

                <li class="li">Provisioning interfaces <p class="p">SS7 does not contain any type of subscriber-related
                        data. All of the account, device, and charging rules are stored only on NCC.
                        RTCC only contains SS7 network-related configuration data. RTCC provides a
                        SOAP-based provisioning interface for SS7 network and SS7 service specific
                        configurations. The operator can configure this by using the SS7 GUI and NCC
                        SS7 UI interfaces. All of the requests from the Web user are received over
                        HTTPS. All one-time configurations are completed via the SS7 GUI.</p>

                </li>

                <li class="li">MariaDB <p class="p">MariaDB provides the database service to all other NCC SS7 services.
                        All of the service data is stored on the MariaDB instance.</p>

                </li>

                <li class="li">MaxScale <p class="p">MaxScale is a database proxy that forwards database statements to
                        one or more database servers. It provides load balancing and high
                        availability functionality. It also monitors and provides for automatic
                        fail-over of a primary/secondary database cluster.</p>

                </li>

                <li class="li">DB Admin <p class="p">DB Admin provides the functionality for the MariaDB cluster
                        administration. It is used for lifecycle and administrative jobs.</p>

                </li>

                <li class="li">SMF <p class="p">Primary Service Management Point (Primary SMP) is the entity that
                        implements Primary Service Management Functions (PSMF). PSMF provides access
                        control, statistics, alarms and data management to operators via the Web
                        GUI. PSMF supports the management part of SS7 Services.</p>

                </li>

                <li class="li">SS7-FEP <p class="p">This represents the Tier 1 executable for Front End process (FEP)
                        software which provides SIGTRAN transport options and consists of stack
                        layers SCCP, M3UA and SCTP. It terminates the Ehternets links for SIGTRAN
                        connectivity.</p>
