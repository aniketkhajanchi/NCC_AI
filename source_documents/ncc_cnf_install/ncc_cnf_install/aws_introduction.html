    <p class="p">Nokia Converged Charging (NCC) is certified for deployment on the Elastic Kubernetes Service
      (EKS) provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). The process of getting the application up and
      running is divided into three parts. First, there are some prerequisites that must be
      satisfied such as having an AWS account, and some basic networking. Then, <span class="ph">NCC</span> provides
      terraform scripts that execute and set up the necessary AWS services for the application.
      Finally, Helm charts deploy the application.</p>

    <p class="p">As part of certification, <span class="ph">NCC</span> has validated that the application can be installed correctly,
      and that it can handle customer traffic load. There is flexibility in the exact AWS resources
      that can be used - such as the type of EC2 instance, but recommendations on what was tested
      are provided.</p>

    <p class="p">This feature is limited to traditional cloud-native network interfaces. The optional SS7
      module along with multus and SCTP are not supported. Testing was done with the AWS provided
      Container Network Interface (CNI).</p>

    <p class="p">Redundancy is provided by installing multiple sites, each in an availability zone. The
      recommendation to use <span class="ph">NCC</span> does not support a single site that spans multiple availability
      zones.</p>

    <p class="p">The solution is single tenant. While the AWS account and network can be shared, the
      deployment assumes it can create its own Kubernetes cluster that is not shared.</p>
