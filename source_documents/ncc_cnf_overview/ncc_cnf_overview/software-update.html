        <p class="p">NCC supports an In-service Software Update (ISU) mechanism that can be performed while
            live traffic continues on the system. This capability leverages the standard Kubernetes
            and Helm capabilities for executing rolling updates of one or more pod instances at a
            time, for a particular microservice. </p>

        <p class="p">Since the update can be performed one pod at a time for a particular microservice, the
            system retains its full engineered capacity during the software update process. This
            provides operators the freedom to perform the update at any time of day, based on
            various factors that might influence this decision.</p>

        <p class="p">NCC supports a rollback procedure to return to the previous version, if any issues are
            experienced during deployment of the update. A rollback might be initiated at any point
            of the update process.</p>

        <p class="p">Special capabilities are incorporated for updating the database services, to ensure the
            steady stream of pods being taken down and updated does not cause unnecessary churn and
            data migration between database pod instances. Database pods also take advantage of
            features related to rack awareness. Database pods are segregated into two virtual racks,
            with one copy of a particular record in each rack. In-service software update takes
            advantage of this rack awareness and may update multiple nodes in parallel to reduce the
            overall update duration.</p>

        <p class="p">For rolling updates to be possible, new software versions and data must be backwards
            compatible with the prior versions and data. While NCC ensures this in its own software
            design, there might be seldom exceptions where an in-service rolling update is not
            possible due to third-party vendor software components whose new software version and
            data is not backwards compatible with their previous version and data. This
            incompatibility would not allow the standard rolling updates to be performed with live
            traffic running, since the new software cannot be running on some pod instances while
            the prior software version is still running on other pod instances. While Nokia strives
            to use ISU whenever possible, there are infrequent updates that require a Network
            in-service Software Update (NSU), where traffic must first be shifted away from this NCC
            during the upgrade, with end-user services continuing uninterrupted at the network level
            via other redundant NCC systems in the network deployment. Experience has shown that
            some industry standard third party components require an NSU for major release upgrades,
            due to their database schema or similar ISU-incompatible changes.</p>

        <p class="p">NCC maintains a persisted data version that is separate from the software version itself.
            Typically, the software update is applied to a subset of SM and ME subsystems, ensuring
            that the new software runs flawlessly with the prior set of features and data. At some
            point, the persisted data version can then be updated to the new version, allowing the
            new software to take advantage of new features that might create new types of data in
            the database.</p>
