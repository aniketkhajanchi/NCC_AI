<div class="body conbody">
                                <p class="p">A Rule Group is a grouping of related Rules that can be run as a
                                                logical group. A Rule Group is usually associated
                                                with one or more Triggers. Rule groups can be used
                                                in one or more triggers to optimize rules and
                                                consistency across different operations. Only the
                                                applicable rule criteria are allowed in a rule group
                                                based on the source context and the trigger to which
                                                the rule group belongs. Then, only the rule actions
                                                applicable to those criteria and triggers can be
                                                configured. </p>

                                <p class="p">In the SM rule list, you can drag the various rules in the rule
                                                group to a level that shows hierarchy to allow for
                                                priority.</p>

                                <p class="p">Rule groups are configured and applied as parent-child sets
                                                related by rule set. You can place the rules
                                                required in one or more top-level stand-alone rule
                                                groups or configure a parent-child set of rule
                                                groups that use the Rule-Table action in the parent
                                                rule group to execute other rule groups. The
                                                execution of all rule groups depend on the
                                                conditions met and associated rule sets. </p>

                                <p class="p">Whether a top-level stand-alone rule group or the top-level
                                                parent rule group of a parent-child type set of rule
                                                groups, you must select the Top Level check box to
                                                ensure that the rule group runs when required. A
                                                top-level standalone rule group does not have
                                                actions that call other rules.</p>

                                <p class="p">The parent-child set of rule groups and pointing the action to
                                                another rule group, you can group rules into
                                                numerous child rule groups whose actions are run
                                                when the correct conditions are met. For this
                                                parent-child type of rule group usage, you must
                                                designate the parent rule group by selecting the Top
                                                Level check box and identify the children by
                                                ensuring that the Top Level check box is not
                                                selected. Further more, The triggers configured for
                                                the child rule groups must include those from the
                                                parent rule group.</p>
