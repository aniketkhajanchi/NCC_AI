        <p class="p">The SM subsystem in NCC includes a User and Role Management component to provide identity
            and access management, and to support standards-based integration into operator
            environments. NCC can be configured to operate in one of three different modes:</p>

        <ul class="ul">
            <li class="li">local auth</li>

            <li class="li">integration with an operator’s Identity Provider (IDP), or</li>

            <li class="li">integration with an operator's Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) user
                database.</li>

        </ul>

        <p class="p">In local auth mode, users are configured using the SM User and Role Management component
            which manages users, passwords, and roles in its MariaDB database. The MariaDB database
            information is replicated between the SM subsystems. This authentication and
            authorization is used for SM GUI user access as well as the SM REST APIs. SM GUI runs an
            embedded client and actively manages the authentication process and renders the GUI
            login screen. Note that when configured in this mode, users may not experience full
            benefits of single sign-on (SSO) and may need to re-login when moving from one type of
            GUI (for example, SM GUI) to a different GUI (for example, metrics viewer GUI).</p>

        <p class="p">Alternatively, NCC can be configured to integrate with an operator's IDP via SAML 2.0 for
            GUI user auth. REST API auth can be configured to either use that same IDP via Open ID
            Connect (OIDC), or REST API auth data can be configured directly into the NCC User and
            Role Management database. In this SAML integration mode, all GUI username / password /
            roles configuration is stored in the operator’s IDP and NCC's User and Role Management
            component is configured to essentially redirect GUI login attempts to the IDP, where
            authentication is managed (including rendering the login screen and managing
            multi-factor authentication if required). If the user authenticates successfully, the
            IDP makes a SAML assertion back to NCC that includes a token with role(s) specified. The
            NCC User and Role Management component is configured to map those IDP roles into the
            local NCC roles and permissions. When configured to integrate in this mode, GUI users
            can experience seamless SSO across the various GUIs within the NCC in their network.</p>

        
        
        <p class="p">When integrated with an operator's IDP via SAML/OIDC, authentication can be impacted if
            the operator's IDP becomes inaccessible (network connectivity issue or an IDP failure,
            either of which should be seldom). To address this use case, NCC can be configured to
            provide GUI users an option to authenticate via the standard corporate directory (for
            example, the operator's IDP), or to use a special emergency access account that can be
            authenticated locally on NCC. In this latter case, NCC itself would render the login
            screen and collect the user credentials, to be authenticated against the local database.
            Operators may choose the option for configuring the REST API users directly into the NCC
            User and Role Management component, in which case the accessibility of the operator's
            IDP is not relevant for REST API auth.</p>

        <p class="p">Finally, NCC supports an additional integration option such that NCC uses LDAP to
            authenticate users. In this case, NCC renders a login screen for GUI users to collect
            their auth credentials and interface with the operator's LDAP directory for
            authentication. In this deployment option, note that SM first checks its local database
            (part of the User and Role Management component) to see if that user is found. If yes,
            local auth is performed. If not found locally, an LDAP query is initiated. Typically,
            operators will keep their GUI users in the remote directory and configure only emergency
            logins in the local NCC database.</p>

        <p class="p">When configured in any of these authentication modes, NCC supports basic auth for its
            REST APIs, meaning that users pass a username and password as part of every API call.
            When configured for integration with the operator’s IDP, NCC supports both basic auth as
            well as token-based auth for its REST APIs, where the user can first get an auth token
            from the IDP and pass that as part of the REST API call to an SM subsystem in NCC.</p>

        <p class="p">The OAuth protocol defines three different message exchange scenarios and the JavaScript
            adapter uses the authorization code flow, during which, the User and Role Management
            component in the NCC SM subsystem server returns an authorization code (not an
            authentication token) to the SM application. The JavaScript adapter exchanges the code
            for an access token and a refresh token after the web browser is redirected back to the
            SM application. The access token is then placed into a bearer authentication HTTP header
            for REST requests to the SM application server.</p>

        <p class="p">The Access token is used with requests to the SM application and has a relatively short
            expiration time. The access token is configured in the realm on the User and Role
            Management component in the NCC SM subsystem and defaults to five minutes.</p>

        <p class="p">The SM application and User and Role Management component communicate by using HTTPS and
            must have all the compatible certificates installed. The User and Role Management
            component has its own keystore and during the system installation, this keystore is
            populated with the same trusted certificates as the SM application (for example,
            dscca.cer). This allows both SM application and User and Role Management server to
            communicate with each other and if any changes are made to the SM application keystore
            after installation, then similar changes are passed on to the User and Role Management
            component keystore as well.</p>
