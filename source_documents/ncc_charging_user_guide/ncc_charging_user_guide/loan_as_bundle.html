<div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">In addition to an amount-based loan, NCC provides an option of a bundle-based loan. When
            this type of loan is opted-in, a new subscription is given to the user without deducting
            any bundle fee. The loan service fee and bundle fee are deducted from the subscriber
            account balance at the time of repayment (top-up) or opting out from the loan service. A
            Subscriber's account can opt in only to one loan. Only loan as Bundle or loan as amount
            can be created at a time. If we are creating loan as Bundle then loan amount should be
            null or 0.</p>

        <div class="section" id="loan_as_bundle__section_b1p_ntf_h5b"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Loan activation (opt in)</h2>
            
            <p class="p">During OPT_IN, if the loan contains <var class="keyword varname">bundleName</var> with
                    <var class="keyword varname">loanAmount</var>=0, then subscription is created without deducting
                the bundle fee from account balance. That is, if subscription is taken from loan and
                if Account has insufficient fund, then also the Subscription is created. Along with
                bundleFee, the serviceFee is added to the remaining debt, which must be re-payed at
                the time of OPT_OUT or top up. Also, if there is an activation fee and it is less
                than account balance, then account balance is adjusted with activation fee. If
                activation fee is more than effective account balance then account balance is set to
                0.</p>

            <p class="p">The subscription created through Bundle based loan has an associated
                    <var class="keyword varname">loanID</var>. Similarly, the loan instance has an associated
                subscription ID.</p>

            <p class="p">During OPT_OUT, if the account has sufficient balance then the remainingDebt is
                re-payed and the loan instance in account is deleted. If account does not have
                sufficient balance, then state is changed to OPT_OUT and remaining debt is adjusted
                with the account balance. For example, if remaining debt is 20 and account balance
                is 15, then remaining debt becomes 5.</p>
