        <p class="p">An NCC network deployment includes a pair of IG systems and optional additional pairs of
            ME systems as required for additional capacity. Much of the data on an SM subsystem is
            replicated across the network with the other SM subsystem, allowing the two SM
            subsystems to operate in an active/active mode. Similarly, much of the data on an ME
            subsystem is replicated across the network with the other ME subsystem in the pair,
            allowing the two ME subsystems to operate in an active/active mode.</p>

        <p class="p">A subscriber or device is homed on a particular ME subsystem and all transactions for
            that subscriber or device are handled by that home ME subsystem. This serialization of
            transactions through a single home ME subsystem ensures proper data integrity and
            consistency and avoids race conditions in the network that could result in a loss of
            that data integrity. If the primary ME subsystem is unable to process traffic, then the
            other ME subsystem in the pair takes over as the currently active home for those
            subscribers or devices normally homed on that failed ME subsystem. Expectation is that
            half of the subscribers or devices served by a particular ME subsystem pair would be
            homed on one ME subsystem in the pair as primary with the other ME subsystem serving as
            secondary home, with the other half being vice-versa. Thus, the ME subsystems in a pair
            are active/active in the normal case, but each active on their own primary subscribers
            or devices.</p>

        <p class="p">The SM subsystems maintain the mapping of which subscribers or devices are homed on which
            ME subsystems. The actual detailed subscriber or device records are stored only on the
            ME subsystems.</p>

        <p class="p">The ME subsystems maintain their own mapping data of which ME subsystems are currently
            the active home for particular subscribers or devices. In a network deployment model
            with Independent ME subsystems, this mapping data includes only those subscribers or
            devices in this ME subsystem pair. In the network deployment model with Networked ME
            subsystems, this mapping data includes all subscribers or devices across all ME
            subsystems in the network. Thus, any call received by a particular ME subsystem can be
            forwarded to the currently active home ME subsystem for that subscriber / devices,
            across any ME subsystem in the network deployment.</p>

        <p class="p">The SM and ME subsystems engage in network heartbeats to ascertain the most accurate
            network view of which ME subsystems are in-service or out-of-service. This ensures
            appropriate differentiation between local network issues and actual failures of an ME
            subsystem in the network and helps avoid split-brain scenarios where both ME subsystems
            in a pair could mistakenly assume they need to be the active home. It also ensures
            consistent network-wide site routing based on a shared network view.</p>

        <p class="p">SM and ME subsystem data stored in the Aerosopike database is replicated to other SM and
            ME subsystems, respectively, by leveraging Aerospike's cross-datacenter replication
            (XDR).</p>
