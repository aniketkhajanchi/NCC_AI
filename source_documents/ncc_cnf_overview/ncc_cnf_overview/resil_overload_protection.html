<div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">If traffic exceeds what the application can handle, NCC has built-in overload protection
            where requests are shed to avoid overwhelming the system. Administrators can configure
            overload protection thresholds in the Service Manager application for both charging and
            servicemanager. All monitoring is done at the pod level and the overload protections are
            applied only to the individual pods that are in trouble.</p>

        <p class="p">Overload protection uses a multi-level escalation model. The system takes into account
            whether a pod is above a high threshold and for how long they have remained above the
            high threshold. Increasingly aggressive remedies are configured as overload states.
            Remedies are attempted and the system waits to see their effect before escalating to a
            higher overload state with a more aggressive remedy. An administrator can configure a
            conservative remedy like rejecting ten percent of traffic from certain non-critical
            APIs. A typical configuration starts to shed new sessions first, while allowing existing
            sessions to continue to be processed as the priority. If a configurable escalation
            interval expires and the pod remains over the threshold, the overload state is increased
            and a new more aggressive remedy is attempted. This sequence of escalating and measuring
            the effect continues until it reaches the top resource critical level.</p>

        <p class="p">Issues found with the pod are configurable as a low threshold, high threshold and
            critical resource threshold. While a high threshold triggers a sequence of remedy
            attempts with time to verify their effect, a pod that exceeds the resource critical
            threshold immediately jumps to the highest overload state with the most aggressive
            remedy. This avoids reacting too slowly when a pod is in serious trouble. As the pod
            recovers, it must fall below the low threshold to de-escalate to the next level down
            (and eventually back to normal state). In case the measured threshold is below the high
            but above the low, the pod remains in its current overload state with the current remedy
            still in effect.</p>
