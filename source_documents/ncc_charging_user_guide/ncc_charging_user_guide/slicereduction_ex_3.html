                <p class="p">This example shows that threshold actions continue to be executed on committed
                    quantities but the allocated slice size is reduced while approaching the
                    threshold value. This results to trigger the threshold actions at more accurate
                    values.</p>

                    <li class="li">
                        <p class="p">The threshold is defined, for example the threshold sends a notification

                        <p class="p">When the iPhone initiates a data call with an RSU of 40 MB, then the
                    amount required to complete the call is reserved from the bucket balance of 200
                    MB. The quota management (slicing profile) rule is executed at the time
                    of reservation and the RSU is modified for the upcoming event value.</p>

                        <p class="p">Given that delta = 100, apply SAF = 0.5 * 100 = 50 and keep the RSU as 40
                            MB only since RSU is less than calculated slice since RSU is less than
                            the calculated slice.</p>

                    </li>

                    <li class="li">
                        <p class="p">iPhone commits 40 MB and requests another call with RSU 100 MB. </p>

                    </li>

                    <li class="li">
                        <p class="p">RSU is modified and delta = 100 - 40 = 60 and apply SAF = 0.5 * 60 = 30.
                            Therefore, RSU is changed to 30 and 100 MB threshold is not crossed, and
                            later, on the committed value, threshold is triggered notifying John
                            about the remaining balance after 100 MB is used.</p>

                    </li>

                    <li class="li">
                        <p class="p">John can commit a new call checking the available balance in his device
                            bucket. In this case, if slicing reduction logic was not executed, then
                            the threshold value may not have triggered a notification until 140 MB
                            of the total resource were used up. But due to modified RSU using slice
                            reduction, John received an early notification because the RSU was
                            modified.</p>
