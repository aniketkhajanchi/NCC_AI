                <p class="p">Following are some important points to note for this feature:</p>

                <ul class="ul" id="slicereduction_d0e2441__ul_sw2_kzk_r4b">
                    <li class="li">
                        <p class="p">This feature does not consider milestones while calculating the slice
                            size.</p>

                    </li>

                    <li class="li">
                        <p class="p">There is no recommended value for the <span class="ph uicontrol">Slice Allocation
                                Factor</span> and <span class="ph uicontrol">MIN Slice Size</span>, but
                            smaller the value of these two parameters, more accurate is the
                            threshold or cap. However, smaller values may impact the performance,
                            therefore, you need to set the value of these parameters to work out
                            both balance performance and accuracy.</p>

                    </li>

            <li class="li">Threshold 0 for bucket is not supported. Hence, it is recommended
                to configure threshold other than 0, that is, minimum 1 byte or equal to minimum
                slice configured in the quota management (slicing profile).</li>

                    <li class="li">
                        <p class="p">The slice reduction logic checks the upcoming threshold for over-commit
                    case. It makes the threshold or cap actions more accurate, but it does not
                    guarantee 100% accuracy due to dynamic scenarios, which contribute to data
                    calls. Following is an example case:</p>

                        <ul class="ul" id="slicereduction_d0e2441__ul_tw2_kzk_r4b">
                            <li class="li">
                                <p class="p">Given that this feature works with respect to the minimum slice
                                    allocation, in case of parallel calls (multiple MSCC or group
                                    sharing) on the same resource, there is a possibility that the
                                    minimum slice allocated to each MSCC or parallel calls may cross
                                    the threshold or cap only at the time of reservation. This may
                                    eventually lead to cross the threshold or cap at commit.</p>

                            </li>

                        </ul>

                    </li>

            <li class="li">
                <p class="p">During slicing reduction, implicit threshold is considered as 100% of the
                    bucket's initial value. Therefore, if no upcoming threshold is present for
                    bucket, then this value of 100% is used to compute the delta. Refer to <a class="xref" href="example_5_bucket_with_implicit_threshold.html">Example 5: Bucket with implicit threshold</a> for an example on how
                    the delta it is computed.</p>

            </li>

            <li class="li">
                <p class="p">For AV scenarios, slice reduction for multiple threshold handling is considered
                    only if Aggregate Type = Charging Service (only for Bucket).</p>

            </li>

            <li class="li">For BOU, slice reduction is considered only if BOU Activation Priority is ON_COMMIT.
                BOU activation works in all or nothing mode. While charging activation fee, if
                    <em class="ph i">REJECT Threshold</em> action is received, it cannot move to next resource for
                charging. If <em class="ph i">STOP Threshold</em> action is received, then also BOU is not
                activated, but it moves to the next resource for charging requested units.</li>

            <li class="li">Multiple thresholds do not work with UC self counter.</li>

                </ul>
