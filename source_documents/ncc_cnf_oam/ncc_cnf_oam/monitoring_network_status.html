        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Heartbeat overview</h2>
            <p class="p">This section describes the <span class="ph">NCC</span> network heartbeat, which
                enables <span class="ph">NCC</span> systems to construct a holistic and robust
                view of the status of the <span class="ph">NCC</span> systems in the network.
                The resulting view is more complete and accurate than if a given <span class="ph">NCC</span> site were to construct this view based on only its
                own visibility and assumptions. This network view is used to determine which sites
                are in-service and out-of-service relative to handling call processing traffic and
                in updating routing tables to ensure messages are routed to the currently active
                home for any given subscriber or device.</p>
</div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Location and community</h2>
            
            <p class="p">Heartbeat uses location data configured in Topology to communicate status about
                connectivity and state. That is, Topology data is used in the determination of
                whether or not a system is in service. A site (location) is a building, complex, or
                buildings in close proximity that house one or more <span class="ph">NCC</span>
                systems (IG and/or MEs). Topology data is configured on each <span class="ph">NCC</span> system in the network to identify the location of
                all <span class="ph">NCC</span> systems with which the IG or ME exchange
                heartbeats. For more information, see the <cite class="cite">Installation and Upgrade
                    guide</cite>.</p>

            <p class="p">In a multi-site network deployment (sites &gt;= 3), heartbeat requires at least one
                other member outside its own site to determine if another member is OOS when it is
                missing a heartbeat with a member. For example, members in close proximity of each
                other (a site) may experience similar network connectivity issues. When connectivity
                to one member is lost, the lack of visibility of that member from another site must
                be confirmed before the member can be declared OOS.</p>

            <div class="note"><div class="notetitle"><img src="../../web/css/../images/note.svg" title="note-icon" class="noteicon" />Note:</div> Site information is used if there are three or more sites. Site information is not
                used if there is less than three sites.</div>

            <p class="p">In a two-site network deployment with two ME subsystems, if the heartbeat is missing
                between members, one system takes over as soon as the configured number of
                heartbeats is missed in one of the systems. However, in the case of a true split
                brain condition some manual intervention to isolate one system or the other may be
                required to set one of the members In-Service. For more information about isolating
                a system, see <a class="xref" href="monitoring_network_status.html#cnf_monitoring_network_status__force">Forcing a system to be In-Service</a>.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">When does an <span class="ph">NCC</span> work on behalf of another <span class="ph">NCC</span> (reroute)</strong></p>

            <p class="p">An ME subsystem always handles its own traffic, unless it goes OOS, which is a local
                decision. An ME subsystem takes over traffic for a remote system that it shares a
                partition with if the other system declares itself OOS, or if a community decision
                is made that it is OOS. <span class="ph">NCC</span> reroutes, or work on behalf
                of another <span class="ph">NCC</span> system when there is no OAM and Diameter
                heartbeat from an <span class="ph">NCC</span> system that is unreachable from
                any other <span class="ph">NCC</span> system. If one or the other heartbeat
                connection is not present, then heartbeat processing uses the status that is
                presented on the remaining heartbeat connection, which could present the system as
                In-service. At least one member from outside of the unreachable system’s own site
                determines whether or not the system is truly out-of-service (OOS). If the system is
                truly OOS as determined from the remote system, the <span class="ph">NCC</span>
                system is treated as OOS by the other members and traffic is rerouted. The SM and ME
                subsystems only use the secondary <span class="ph">NCC</span> when the primary
                NCC has zero indications of life from its own Diameter connectivity (ME subsystems
                only) and from the reports of the other <span class="ph">NCC</span>
                systems.</p>

            <p class="p">This figure illustrates an example of heartbeat detection and how the subsequent
                decisions are made. </p>

            <div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap"><span class="fig--title-label">Figure: </span>Heartbeat detection and subsequent decisions</span>
                
                <img class="image break" src="../images/geohbdetectionanddecision_default.gif" width="576" />
            </div>

            <p class="p">In example A in the figure, all members get a direct heartbeat from ME 3 over OAM, so
                there is no group decision. A group decision is made only if a direct heartbeat is
                not achieved. If ME 3 reports itself as OOS, all other <span class="ph">NCC</span> systems switch to the secondary ME subsystem for
                transactions normally homed on ME 3. If ME 3 reports itself as In-Service,
                transactions normally homed on ME 3 continue to be routed to ME 3.</p>

            <p class="p">In example B in the figure, all <span class="ph">NCC</span> systems detect loss
                of connectivity and loss of heartbeat, but the previous status of ME 3 from other
                    <span class="ph">NCC</span> systems is In-Service. All <span class="ph">NCC</span> systems provide their view that ME 3 is OOS. All
                    <span class="ph">NCC</span> systems build a view that themselves and all
                others list ME 3 as OOS. All <span class="ph">NCC</span> systems switch to the
                secondary ME subsystem for transactions normally homed on ME 3.</p>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Heartbeat in a geo-redundant <span class="ph">NCC</span> network

            <p class="p">Site (location) information in the <span class="ph">NCC</span> configuration
                files enhances the heartbeat component to use that location information for
                determination of status–IS or OOS. First, <span class="ph">NCC</span>
                determines if there is a third site from which to receive confirmation of a
                heartbeat, and second, <span class="ph">NCC</span> uses that confirmation from
                any <span class="ph">NCC</span> system at a third site to determine that a
                system not sending heartbeats is actually OOS.</p>

            <p class="p">Information that is communicated in the heartbeat is used by:</p>
<ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">The Timed Event Manager (TEM) to determine whether the Primary system should
                    process events for its Secondary system, when the Secondary is determined to be
                    OOS. Session audits and monthly account resets are examples of TEM events.</li>

                <li class="li">The Diameter site routing plug-in to make decisions on how to route Diameter
                    requests based on the states of the Primary and Secondary systems.</li>

                <li class="li">The SM subsystem to monitor the status of the <span class="ph">NCC</span>
                    systems it manages and the state of the other SM subsystem.</li>

            </ul>

            <p class="p">NCC waits for the receipt of all reports from all members or the next polling
                interval before processing and making a decision on whether to change the membership
                status and/or the network view.</p>

            <p class="p">To determine a system's component status as IS or OOS, each member <span class="ph">NCC</span> system in the network deployment provides its state
                and view of the other <span class="ph">NCC</span> systems as the heartbeat
                monitor polls for status. <span class="ph">NCC</span> tracks these items for
                polled status:</p>
<ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">member's component status (IN_SERVICE, OUT_OF_SERVICE, UNKNOWN). </li>

                <li class="li">number of missed heartbeats with member over OAM. </li>

                <li class="li">number of missed heartbeats with member over diameter if applicable. </li>

                <li class="li">timestamp of last heartbeat with member (Used for logging). </li>

                <li class="li">timestamp of last attempted heartbeat with member (Used for logging). </li>

            </ul>

            <p class="p">To be determined truly out of service where there are three or more sites, at least
                one member of the community that is located outside of the unreachable system's own
                site must see the offending system as OOS. </p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Heartbeat polling</h2>
            
            <p class="p">When <span class="ph">NCC</span> starts up, heartbeat loads the topology for the
                members and then attempts to poll them. Polling goes in rounds; each member is
                polled in every round. During a heartbeat round, a polled member's heartbeat
                responds with its subsystem (for example, ME or SM) states for itself and other
                members subsystem states for the others. Any members that do not return a response
                go through an evaluation to determine what state should be used for them. The
                initial state for its members’ subsystems is UNKNOWN until they are polled.</p>

            <p class="p">The initial status of a member's subsystem state starts as UNKOWN, and remains that
                way until a response is received. Then it transitions to the state that is returned
                in the poll, either IN_SERVICE or OUT_OF_SERVICE.</p>

            <p class="p">When polling begins, the heartbeat monitor queries the remote web service, over the
                OAM network, that is served on the floating IP address of the active/standby
                centralmanagement pods. Then the web service queries the local Heartbeat Monitor to
                get the local states for its components, as well as its view of the network and
                returns it. This figure shows the heartbeat poll over the OAM network.</p>

            <div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap"><span class="fig--title-label">Figure: </span>Heartbeat poll over the OAM network</span>
                
                <img class="image break" src="../images/geohboam3d_default.gif" width="576" />
            </div>

            <p class="p">The Diameter network polling occurs in parallel with the OAM network polling. The
                centralmanagement pod triggers the request, and then the application server sends
                the Diameter message to the remote system. The application server on the remote
                system queries its local centralmanagement monitoring service to retrieve the
                subsystem statuses and return them. In the case that the remote centralmanagement
                monitoring service is in the middle of an activity switch, the application container
                will only return its own system's subsystem statuses without the network view as it
                does not have access to the information.</p>

            <div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap"><span class="fig--title-label">Figure: </span>Heartbeat poll over the Diameter network</span>
                
                
                <img class="image break" src="../images/geohb3d_default.gif" width="576" />
            </div>

            <p class="p">The poll is sent out to the subsystems of the remote member. If a heartbeat is
                received, the reported status is used; otherwise, a check is performed to see if
                there has been enough missed heartbeats to make a decision. If the missed heartbeat
                threshold has been exceeded, there is a check to see if any system has seen that
                member as up. If yes, then the member is treated as in service. If not, then all
                members polled see the member is OOS. Then a check is performed to see if the
                polling system can see another site to ensure it is not the problem. If all systems
                see the member is down, and the polling system can see at least one other site, the
                member’s subsystem is declared down, an alarm is raised indicating that the
                subsystem is OOS and there is consensus from the community.</p>

            <p class="p">In a site with three or more systems, when considering a decision as to whether or
                not a subsystem in a site is OOS and to avoid making decisions on stale data, the
                decision is based on the input of other community members with whom heartbeat data
                is shared. If one or both are received then the heartbeat was successful. If a
                system has missed heartbeats with another member and has exceeded the missing
                heartbeat threshold (Missed threshold), it uses its community’s view of the system
                to determine if the subsystem is OOS. A heartbeat is missed if no result (Diameter
                or OAM) is received in a round.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Member response to heartbeat polling</h2>
            
            <p class="p">When polled, a member not only responds with its state, but it also responds with its
                view of the community. When one member misses a heartbeat with another member
                (member X) of the community, it searches all the other member's responses (from that
                heartbeat round) for their view of member X to see if it can reach a decision about
                member X's state. </p>

            <p class="p">When a system is polled, it can report the other member’s subsystem as being:</p>
<ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">
                    <p class="p">Unknown</p>

                    <p class="p">The initial state for its members’ subsystems is Unknown until they are
                        polled. A member cannot report its own status as unknown.</p>

                <li class="li">

                    <p class="p">If the polling system has polled the member’s subsystem and it has reported
                        itself OOS, or if the polling system polled the member’s subsystem and the

                </li>

            </ul>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Logging</h2>
            
            <p class="p">Heartbeat status information from other members of the community is logged in the
                SPSServer.log. Most logging is at the debug level, but status changes for systems
                are logged at the info level. At start up, there is no previous poll with members;
                therefore, statuses of Unknown are expected. After start up and the first polling,
                statuses are reported. The status is maintained in memory and logged.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Activity switches on centralmanagement pods</h2>
            
            <p class="p">When an activity switch occurs on centralmanagement pods, the primary heartbeat
                service is down until the floating IP Address is switched over and the heartbeat
                service is started on the new active centralmanagement pod. The duration of this
                event could be longer than the time it takes to declare a subsystem out of service
                (number of missed heartbeats * polling interval).</p>

            <p class="p">To prevent other <span class="ph">NCC</span> members from erroneously taking
                over processing with the activity switch, the Diameter heartbeat continues to
                respond to incoming requests, but it only responds with the subsystem statuses of
                the local member. It does not communicate the network view as that is only
                maintained on the OAM heartbeat service on the centralmanagement pods and the
                Diameter heartbeat service cannot retrieve that information from the
                centralmanagement pods during the activity switch.</p>

            <div class="note"><div class="notetitle"><img src="../../web/css/../images/note.svg" title="note-icon" class="noteicon" />Note:</div> In an IG system (containing both SM and ME subsystems), the forced in service tool
                can be used on the system affecting all subsystems, or it can be used to force
                individual subsystems in service if necessary. For more information on the tool, see
                    <a class="xref" href="monitoring_network_status.html#cnf_monitoring_network_status__force">Forcing a system to be In-Service</a>.</div>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">On-demand heartbeat status</h2>
            <p class="p">Tools are available to get the heartbeat status on demand. For the local system
                status, use the network-status tool. For more information on the tool, see <a class="xref" href="TPA_heartbeatStatus.html">network-status</a>.</p>

            <p class="p">In a network deployment that consists only of a pair of IG systems, there may be a
                time when an <span class="ph">NCC</span> system cannot heartbeat with the other
                system and you must manually override the OOS decision that the heartbeat has made.
                This would be a situation where network connectivity is problematic because both the
                OAM and Diameter networks are severed between two sites, but both ME subsystems and
                SM subsystems are processing on behalf of the ones in the other system.</p>

            <p class="p">In a network deployment with two IG systems and two standalone ME systems, in a total
                of two sites, it is possible to enter a true split-brain condition. In this case,
                members from one site cannot see members from the other site, which causes them to
                incorrectly start processing on the other members behalf while they are still
                processing their own traffic and TEM events. When the communication cannot be
                restored, the force-remote-site-in-service tool can be used to treat the other
                member as In-Service so that processing on behalf of that member will stop. The tool
                overrides the heartbeat decision for the member that this tool is run on, until a
                direct heartbeat is received from the errant member.</p>

            <p class="p">In this example, when an <span class="ph">NCC</span> system in Site 1 cannot see
                an <span class="ph">NCC</span> system in Site 2, and the other way around, the
                tool needs to be run on all systems. When this tool is used to force a member IS,
                the "NCC treating other member as if heartbeat received In Service" alarm is
                generated. When the tool clears the heartbeat status, it raises "NCC heartbeat
                treatment returned to normal" and then clears the first alarm. </p>

            <p class="p">The forced In-Service treatment ends when a heartbeat is actually received from the
                errant NCC, which indicates a status other than In-Service or after 10 minutes of
                In-Service heartbeats are received without missing the number of heartbeats that are
                required to consider it OOS. When this occurs, the "NCC heartbeat treatment
                automatically reset to normal" alarm is raised. If an activity switch of the
                centralmanagement pod occurs in the 10 minute window, the count is reset when the
                standby takes over.</p>

            <p class="p">The tool also provides an option to list any active forced In-Service members and an
                option to manually clear the forced In-Service state of a specific NCC. For more
                information on the tool, see <a class="xref" href="force_remote_site_in_service.html">force-remote-site-in-service</a>.</p>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Heartbeat alarming</h2>
            
            <div class="note"><div class="notetitle"><img src="../../web/css/../images/note.svg" title="note-icon" class="noteicon" />Note:</div> Alarms are raised per monitored subsystem, so in an integrated system an alarm is
                raised against the SM and the ME subsystems individually. The "NCC unreachable Over
                Diameter" is an exception, as it does not differ based on subsystem.</div>

            <p class="p">There are different alarms that can be raised by the heartbeat monitor. The alarms
                cover scenarios where OOS is declared in a network with at least three sites, where
                a remote member is OOS, and where Diameter heartbeats are missed with a member. This
                is a list of how the alarms are named:</p>
<ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">“NCC unreachable over Diameter” is the alarm raised when Diameter heartbeats are
                    missed. </li>

                <li class="li">“NCC was determined to be Out-Of-Service” is the alarm raised when the heartbeat
                    sees the remote member as OOS. </li>

                <li class="li">
                    <p class="p">“Heartbeat is missing with member” is the alarm raised when there are more
                        than three sites and a member is:</p>
<ul class="ul">
                        <li class="li">missing a heartbeat, but someone continues to see the member as IS. </li>

                        <li class="li">missing a heartbeat, and everyone sees OOS, but no other location is
                            seen. </li>

                        <li class="li">missing a heartbeat, and everyone sees OOS, but another location is
                            seen. <p class="p">Only one of above can be raised at a time.</p>

                        </li>

                    </ul>

                </li>

            </ul>

            <p class="p">If the deployment has less than three sites, the missing heartbeat alarms are raised
                when a member is:</p>
<ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">missing a heartbeat, but someone continues to see the member as IS. </li>

                <li class="li">missing a heartbeat, and everyone sees OOS. </li>

            </ul>

            <p class="p">These scenarios describe the use cases where the above alarms are generated by the
                heartbeat monitor in networks that have at least three sites and where heartbeats
                with the other member have been missed.</p>
<ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">Alarm 1: If the heartbeat between this system and the remote system is down, all
                    members reporting a heartbeat agree that the remote system is unreachable or
                    OOS. At least one of the reporters is from another site. The remote system is
                    treated as OOS.</li>

                <li class="li">Alarm 2: If the heartbeat between this system and the remote system is down and
                    all members reporting a heartbeat agree that the remote system is unreachable or
                    OOS, but you can only see members at your site, the problem may be with the
                    systems at this site. The member is treated by its last known status, which
                    could be IS or OOS.</li>

                <li class="li">Alarm 3: If the Heartbeat is missing with member, at least one other member that
                    received heartbeats from can see the remote system as in service.</li>

            </ul>

            <p class="p">In configurations with less than three sites where the heartbeat between this system
                and the remote system is down, the remote system is treated as OOS.</p>

            <p class="p">Only one of the above alarms exists per member with polling. If there is a status
                change to a more or less severe scenario, then the existing alarm is cleared and a
                new alarm is raised. A heartbeat alarm is cleared when the member no longer misses a
                heartbeat, or when the conditions of another alarm is met. If another alarm
                condition is met, the new alarm is raised in its place. If the heartbeat returns,
                any active alarm is cleared.</p>

            <p class="p">This example demonstrates how the alarms are raised and cleared when there are at
                least three sites in the network:</p>
<ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">
                    <p class="p">Multiple alarms can be raised but only one alarm per member. For example, in
                        a four-member network, Member 1 does not have a heartbeat with Member 2 or
                        Member 3, but is polling with Member 4. Member 4 sees both Member 2 and
                        Member 3 as in service. On Member 1, these alarms are raised:</p>

                        <li class="li">ALARM3 for Member 2</li>

                    </ul>

                <li class="li">
                    <p class="p">Transitions from an existing alarm to another alarm where Member 1 does not
                        have a heartbeat with Member 2.  However, Members 3 and 4 continue to see
                        Member 2 as in service.  The current alarm state is:</p>

                    <p class="p">On the next heart beat round, Members 3 and 4 report Member 2 as OOS. Member

                        response from Member 2. Member 2 reports itself as OOS, but because there
