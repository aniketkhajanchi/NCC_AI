<div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">Some operators have multiple Wide Area Networks (WANs) to enable separation of different
            types of traffic over different WANs. The various WANs might have specific purposes and
            might have different performance characteristics relative to bandwidth, latency, quality
            of service, and so on.</p>

        <p class="p">NCC supports deployment into these network environments and can be configured to flexibly
            receive and route its different traffic types over different networks based on
            configured target FQDNs.</p>

        <p class="p">NCC routing to other NCC systems and other external network elements is configured with
            FQDNs. The translation of FQDN to IP address (and which WAN) is the responsibility of
            the operator’s CaaS that NCC is deployed into. The CaaS provides the needed routing and
            IP infrastructure.</p>

        <div class="section" id="traffic_routing_over_multiple_networks__section_ewr_pwg_yqb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Ingress traffic</h2>
            
            <p class="p">For ingress traffic, NCC listens for traffic at the FQDNs that are configured for
                each of these three types of traffic:</p>

                </li>

            </ul>

            <p class="p">If an operator has only one or two of the above three types of WANs, an operator can
                configure the same FQDNs to be the same across different traffic types. (For
                example, the same FQDN could be used for both OAM and Provisioning traffic).</p>

            <p class="p">An operator might need to assign to NCC more than one FQDN for each of the three
                traffic types above. NCC can accommodate this in its configuration (in Input
                Generator) by allowing a comma-separated list of FQDNs for each of the above traffic
                types. For example, if an operator has separate WANs for 4G and 5G traffic, an
                operator would list multiple FQDNs for the Call Processing traffic entry and NCC
                will listen on all of them.</p>

            <p class="p">FQDNs are configured in the Input Generator spreadsheet. Each NCC system has its own
                tab in the Input Generator spreadsheet. The FQDNs that a given NCC system will
                listen on are listed in that instance's tab.</p>

            <p class="p">Note that the Input Generator has two sets of rows for each of the three traffic
                types. One set is used for TLS traffic and the other is used for mTLS traffic. This
                enables different operators to configure NCC as per their network approach for TLS
                vs. mTLS.</p>

        <div class="section" id="traffic_routing_over_multiple_networks__section_jwr_pwg_yqb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Egress traffic</h2>
            
            <p class="p">There are two categories of egress traffic leaving NCC – traffic to other NCC systems
                and traffic to other external (non-NCC) network elements such as PGW, SMF, alarm
                manager, and so on.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Routing to other NCC systems</strong></p>

            <p class="p">When NCC system A needs to send a message to NCC system B, it looks up the FQDN
                parameters configured in the Input Generator in the tab for target NCC B, to see its
                list of FQDNs for the given traffic type. If there are multiple FQDNs configured for
                that traffic type, then the first FQDN in the list is used as the egress target.</p>

            <p class="p">All NCC egress traffic to other NCC systems fall into one of the three traffic types
                outlined in this section.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Routing to other external network elements</strong></p>

            <p class="p">Routing to other external network elements is controlled by separate configurable
                parameters for each of those target destinations. Therefore, there is no specific
                constraint on which network or how many networks might be used across the various
                external network elements. Operators configure NCC with FQDNs for each of the
                various external network elements.</p>
