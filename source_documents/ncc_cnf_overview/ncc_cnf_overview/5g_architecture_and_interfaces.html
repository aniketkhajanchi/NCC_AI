        <div class="p">The 5G architecture is defined as service-based and the interaction between network
            functions is represented using service-based interfaces for their interactions. The
            service-based architecture uses network functions (for example, Session Management
            Function (SMF)) within the control plane to enable other authorized network functions to
            access their services. A subset of the 5G service-based architecture with the supported
            protocol interfaces is shown in this figure. <div class="fig fignone" id="e34_zts_qlb__fig_hc3_sjg_dmb"><span class="figcap"><span class="fig--title-label">Figure: </span>5G architecture and interfaces in NCC</span>

        <p class="p">NCC supports the Charging Function (CHF). NCC supports interfaces such as N28 interface
            between CHF and PCF as defined in 3GPP standard 29.594. NCC provides charging support
            for Nchf_SpendingLimitControl (N28). The Nchf_SpendingLimitControl service enables
            transfer of policy counter status information relating to subscriber spending limits
            from the CHF to the NF consumer.</p>

        <p class="p">NCC also supports the N40 interface between SMF and CHF as defined in TS 32.240 to enable
            online and offline charging.</p>

        <p class="p">Incoming 5G messages arrive on HTTP/2 and come through the HTTP ingress gateway. They are
            then load balanced to the charging pods. Responses are delivered back through the HTTP
            infrastructure to the originating source.</p>

        <p class="p">If the subscriber / device for a received 5G message is not homed on the receiving NCC ME
            subsystem, the charging pod on that ME subsystem leverages its site routing function to
            determine the currently active home ME subsystem. The message is routed to the
            destination home ME subsystem, where it gets appropriately processed per 5G
            requirements. Responses back to the originating source are over HTTP/2, just as the
            initial message.</p>

        <p class="p">NCC supports metrics for 5G message handling that enable separate analysis from the 4G
            Diameter message handling. For more information about 5G metrics, see the <cite class="cite">Metrics
                Spreadsheet</cite> in the NCC documentation set.</p>
