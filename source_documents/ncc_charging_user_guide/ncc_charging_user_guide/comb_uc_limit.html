            <p class="p">You can combine usage for multiple Counters (for example, data usage for 4G and 5G
                counters). That is, a single combined usage control limit applies on usage for
                multiple reference counters. Use the parameters <span class="ph uicontrol">Counter Name</span>
                and <span class="ph uicontrol">Referenced counter IDs</span>. </p>

            <p class="p">After the combined usage limit is applied, the attributes <span class="ph uicontrol">Counter
                    Name</span> and <span class="ph uicontrol">Referenced counter IDs</span> become
                visible in <span class="ph uicontrol">Device overview</span>. However, <span class="ph uicontrol">Referenced
                    counter IDs</span> only shows the counter(s) attached to the subscribed
                bundles, and not all defined in UC definition. </p>

            <p class="p">The application preference <span class="ph uicontrol">Enable UC Sync For API</span> is available
                for enabling UC synchronization with the UC definition through the read APIs for
                Device, Account, Subscription, and Profile. Refer to the <em class="ph i">Global Configuration
                    Guide</em> for more details about this application preference.</p>

            <p class="p">Multi-reference self-counter accumulates usage of other counters, and it does not
                have its own lifecycle. It does not reset with lifecycle or for the bundle from
                which the consumption is being done. Reset is governed by the reference counters,
                that is, when any of the reference counters for the multi-reference self-counter is
                reset, the value is modified according to it. On Counter renewal or reset when the
                current value is moved to the previous value, the previous value is also updated by
                accumulating previous values of the referenced counters.</p>

                <li class="li">For slice reduction, the updated value of UC multi-reference self-counter after
                    committing is used. In case of <var class="keyword varname">Notification stop</var> on
                    multi-reference self-counter it works as <var class="keyword varname">Notification
                        continue</var>.</li>

                <li class="li">Even if applicability is configured in UC, the multi-reference self-counter sums
                    up all counters mentioned in reference irrespective of the different
                    applicability conditions of reference counters.</li>

                <li class="li">Policy counter and SNR are not supported.</li>

                <li class="li">Reserved quota is NOT considered when allocating new quota based on any
                    counter’s current value (including the multi-reference self-counter).</li>

                <li class="li">Multi-reference self-counter value is considered for slice reduction even in the
                    case of No-Charge and all other resource types.</li>

                <li class="li">Do not applicability condition of the multi-reference self-counter to accumulate
                    counter applicable to the same RGs as it will lead to a double addition in the
                    consumption.</li>

                <li class="li">If the definition of UC is modified, RAR is not generated for any session.</li>

                <li class="li">If any usage service is configured with self-counter and old reference counter,
                    then its behavior is not affected by combined UC limit.</li>

                <li class="li">As multi-reference self-counters have references of multiple counters (for
                    example, reference counters shared between parents and child), and there may be
                    scenarios where the reference counter continues to increase even when the
                    threshold has reached for the UC self-counter, as a result, the UC self-counter
                    value can be more than the limit.</li>

                <li class="li">Final subscription counters are not considered in the multi-reference
                    counter.</li>

                <li class="li">Barred subscription counters are considered in the multi-reference counter.</li>

                <li class="li">In patch API to update UcServiceInstance, list of reference counters cannot be
                    modified.</li>

                <li class="li">Only reference counters can be selected for accumulation in multi-reference

                <li class="li">During UC definition if TPG and limit are updated, then it is not considered. If
                    UC is already subscribed the instance must be updated to update TPG and
