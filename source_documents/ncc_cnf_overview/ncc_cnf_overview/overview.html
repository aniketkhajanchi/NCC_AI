        <p class="p">The Telemetry services provide all the services for logs, alarms, metrics, and
            notifications. Metrics are stored in Prometheus and are available to be viewed via a
            metrics viewer. They can also be written into 3GPPXML files for later retrieval via SFTP
            (for example, by northbound OSS sytems). Prometheus also provides an option for
            remote-write to external targets. Logs and alarms are written to stdout and consumed by
            Fluentd, which routes them to the appropriate microservices. Logs and alarms are stored
            in OpenSearch and are available for filtering and viewing via the OpenSearch Dashboard.
            Alarms are also stored in a MariaDB. Alarms are sent to northbound systems via SNMP
            traps. Finally, a VES (Vendor Event Stream) option is available for streaming logs,
            alarms, and metrics offboard into a single event stream per the VES specification
            (supporting ONAP, Open Network Automation Platform), to be consumed by the operator's
            VES collector. This figure shows NCC Telemetry.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="p">This includes the EFK stack with Fluentd and OpenSearch. Prometheus and a metrics viewer
            are included for metrics handling. Nokia Gen3GPPXML tool is included for creating XML
            files for enabling northbound systems to collect the metrics using SFTP. Finally, an
            alarm management component is included that can manage alarms and send using SMPP.</p>

        <p class="p">As a deployment option, NCC can include a set of telemetry services by delivering NCC
            Telemetry. Some operators might already have their own telemetry infrastructure and need
            NCC to integrate into that. There are various ways how this might be achieved and
            further discussion with Nokia is required to align on a specific strategy and its
            details. Examples might include having the operator's Fluentd read the
                <span class="ph filepath">stdout</span> for logs and alarms, potentially configured to feed
            those back into the NCC telemetry for its own local collection, and/or having NCC stream
            alarms, logs, and metrics out using a common VES. In some cases, it might be required
            that NCC keeps a local copy of its own telemetry for troubleshooting purposes, even if
            the operator has their own telemetry infrastructure.</p>
