<div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">All rule groups and variables are part of a container called a Rule System Version (RSV).
            The RSV container supports rule operations such as rule or variable authoring, cloning,
            exporting, and importing. This is essential for the purpose of the rule logic being
            modified. An RSV is created on the SM subsystem and then the entire RSV is distributed
            to the ME subsystems.</p>

        <p class="p">When an RSV is activated, all rule groups that belong to the rule system version are
            evaluated and the rules can be executed by the Rule Engine as triggered in an order of
            precedence.</p>

        <p class="p">NCC supports the export and import of the entire RSV between NCC systems running the same
            version.</p>

        <p class="p">A read-only Default RSV is created automatically when NCC is started for the first time
            after installation. The Default RSV contains all of the triggers and rule groups that
            are required for the startup of an NCC and appears in the GUI in the Active state.</p>

        <p class="p">Any of the Draft versions or Release versions can be deleted. An Active rule system
            version cannot be modified or deleted.</p>

        <div class="p">The general workflow for the RSV is: <ul class="ul" id="rule_system_versioning__ul_dtn_nqs_4lb">
                <li class="li">Create or modify rules in a Draft version.</li>

                <li class="li">Change the Draft version to a Release or an Active version. <p class="p">All rules
                        attribute dictionaries, provisioned/predefined rules, and rule variables are
                        loaded when a version is promoted to the Active version. </p>
</li>

                <li class="li">If necessary, change the Release version to the Active version. <p class="p">All rules
                        attribute dictionaries, provisioned/predefined rules, and rule variables are
                        loaded when a version is promoted to the Active version.</p>
</li>

                <li class="li">Provision and activate the RSV on each geo-redundantly related ME, as
                    necessary.</li>

                <li class="li">Create subsequent versions as Draft versions and change the versions as
                    required.</li>

            </ul>
</div>

        <p class="p">Only one rule system version can be in an Active state at any time. When a Release
            version is promoted to the Active state, the last Active version is automatically
            demoted to a Release state.</p>

        <p class="p">For more information about RSVs and provisioning rules and variables, see the
                <cite class="cite">Charging Rules</cite> section of the <cite class="cite">Charging User Guide</cite>.</p>
