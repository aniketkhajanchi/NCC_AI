            <p class="p">The maintenance of GUI users, passwords, and role mapping are performed by using the
                User and Role Management GUI. These tasks are performed by the administrator. The
                user administration on the <span class="ph">NCC</span> GUI is replaced by the
                User and Role Management GUI, wherein the user logs in again as a User and Role
                Management administrator to perform actions other than changing their own
                password.</p>

            <p class="p">If <span class="ph">NCC</span> is integrated into the your SSO environment, or
                is configured to use LDAP to a remote authentication server, then users are NOT
                configured into <span class="ph">NCC</span>. The only users configured into <span class="ph">NCC</span> would be a few special users for emergency access
                in case the your authentication servers are inaccessible.</p>
