        <p class="p">This section provides the overview of the Charging application. For more information
            about the Charging application, see the <cite class="cite">Charging User Guide</cite> in the NCC
            documentation set.</p>

        <p class="p">The Charging application receives and processes various types of network requests related
            to subscribers and performs rating and charging functions inside NCC. The application
            performs these functions:</p>

        <ul class="ul" id="charging_application__ul_k15_lq4_r5b">
            <li class="li">subscriber rating and charging based on the different criteria and rules (using
                A.R.T rules) that are configured by operators as per their market offers</li>

            <li class="li">supports group solutions ranging from a small group to a big group</li>

            <li class="li">supports MVNO for multi-tenant solutions</li>

            <li class="li">enables service operators to control their offers and interactions with
                subscribers</li>

            <li class="li">addresses the data market based on advanced 5G HTTP/2 and native 4G Diameter
                interface</li>

            <li class="li">supports IMS/SMS/MMS services over 4G Diameter protocol</li>

            <li class="li">performs the role of an Online Charging Function (OCF) or Charging Function (CHF)
                for 4G and 5G interfaces respectively</li>

            <li class="li">supports 5G interfaces N40, N28, N41 and N44 by interacting with SMF and PCF.
                Interacts for NRF registration for 5G interface.</li>

            <li class="li">performs service and subscriber-related configuration over REST interface</li>

            <li class="li">supports IoT devices use cases over 5G. For more information, see the <cite class="cite">Charging
                    User Guide</cite> and <cite class="cite">Standard Compliance and Interface Reference</cite>. </li>

            <li class="li">supports a set of TMF standards API. For more information about TMF API, see
                    <cite class="cite">TMF Open API Specifications</cite> in the NCC documentation set.</li>

            <li class="li">capability to act as an NCC router for 5G data traffic where 5G requests (N40) are
                converted to 4G diameter (Gy) and then forwarded to legacy 4G OCS of the operators
                based on certain configurable rules. It also generates CDR based on the 32.298
                format for such requests. For more details about 32.298, see the <cite class="cite">CDR/EDR
                    Reference</cite>. </li>

        </ul>

        <p class="p">The Charging application uses Ro and Gy Diameter interfaces as native interfaces for
            rating and charging for various types of subscriber requests like data, voice, SMS &amp;
            MMS services. The charging application supports the advance 5G interface for rating and
            charging of data services. These subscriber events can either be session-based or
            event-based. The application uses Sy (4G) and N28 (5G) interfaces to interact with
            PCRF/PCF to enforce subscriber policy decisions.</p>

        <p class="p">For more information/compliancy about 4G/5G interfaces, see the <cite class="cite">Charging User
                Guide</cite> and <cite class="cite">Standard Compliance and Interface Reference</cite>. </p>
