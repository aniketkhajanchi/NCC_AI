<div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">If one of the SMs in a <span class="ph">NCC</span> 22.3 (or later) deployment is affected by a disaster, either
            non-catastrophic, where loss of data occurred for an extended period of time, or
            catastrophic, like an earthquake or a flood, where the complete Kubernetes cluster is
            gone, a procedure needs to be followed to bring back the system to normal
            operations.</p>

        <p class="p">The scope of this procedure is limited to the recovery of SM/IG systems, as the recovery
            for other types of systems (ME) is already addressed by existing documentation: <a class="xref" href="disaster_recovery.html">Disaster recovery (DR)</a>.</p>

        <p class="p">In the instructions provided here, it is assumed that the deployment has four SM systems
            or two IG systems and one needs to be recovered. The same instructions can be used for a
            deployment with two SMs. </p>

        <p class="p">In order to provide as many details as possible, some examples are included for the
            commands to be performed on the healthy systems(s) in the deployment and on the
            recovering system. To make the instructions clear we use SM system names from an example
            deployment where the SMs are named SM1, SM2, SM3 and SM4, and SM4 is the failed SM which
            is being recovered. </p>

        <div class="note"><div class="notetitle"><img src="../../web/css/../images/note.svg" title="note-icon" class="noteicon" />Note:</div> It is assumed that Backup and Recovery was configured to store backup data on a 3rd party system, not
            locally, so even in case of catastrophic disaster the backup data can be accessed
            without problems when Backup and Recovery is re-installed with the same configuration. If that is not
            the case, it is expected that all the backup data stored locally on Backup and Recovery was
            periodically copied to another location, so it could be restored after re-installing
            Backup and Recovery. This step is outside the scope of this procedure.</div>
