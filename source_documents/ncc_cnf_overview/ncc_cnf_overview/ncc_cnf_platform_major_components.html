                <p class="p">The NCC architecture consists of several groups of microservices, including:</p>

                <ul class="ul" id="ncc_cnf_platform_major_components__ul_vyg_4dk_5nb">
                        <li class="li">Ingress and Load Balancers<p class="p">These services terminate the incoming
                                        traffic and load balance it to the appropriate pod instances
                                        within the NCC.</p>
</li>

                        <li class="li">Service Manager<p class="p">These microservices are unique for the SM subsystem.
                                        These microservices terminate the external SOAP and REST
                                        APIs and manage the data provisioning for all of the NCC
                                        systems in the network. The SM subsystem provides a GUI for
                                        manual data viewing and updates, and also includes a User
                                        and Role Management component for managing the
                                        authentication and authorization of GUI and API
                                users.</p>
</li>

                        <li class="li">SS7 Call Handling<p class="p">These microservices provide the protocol handling
                                        and business logic associated with SS7-related services in
                                        NCC. </p>
</li>

                        <li class="li">Internal Queues and Pub/Sub<p class="p"> These provide mechanisms for NCC services
                                        to publish events and other queued information to a variety
                                        of NCC services that are subscribed. Kafka is used for
                                        forwarding CDR requests from the charging application to the
                                        Charging Gateway Function (CGF). Kafka is also used for a
                                        variety of publish / subscribe (pub/sub) services. For
                                        example, the database publishes data change notifications to
                                        any clients who have subscribed. These microservices also
                                        provide a timed events manager and inform subscribers when
                                        given events are triggered.</p>
</li>

                        <li class="li">Subscriber Database Services<p class="p">This group of microservices provides a
                                        variety of services related to the subscriber data that is
                                        managed by the charging application. This includes the NoSQL
                                        database and its replication across other NCC systems in the
                                        network deployment. It also includes the services for
                                        ensuring data integrity, including serializing transactions
                                        through an active home ME subsystem for each particular
                                        subscriber and routing the messages to the correct ME
                                        subsystem in the network. Data integrity is also ensured by
                                        a lock and transaction manager to mange the simultaneous
                                        requests for a specific database record, with capabilities
                                        for rollback of failed transactions.</p>
</li>

                        <li class="li">System Configuration and Management<p class="p">These microservices provide system
                                        level configuration, service discovery, and monitoring. This
                                        includes network heartbeat communication with other NCC
                                        systems in the network deployment to construct an accurate
                                        view of NCC system status and avoidance of scenarios such as
                                        split-brain behavior. This also includes system-level local
                                        monitoring that considers the composite view of local
                                        service instances to determine the overall health of the
                                        local system, what to communicate in the heartbeat, and
                                        whether the system is healthy to be in-service for offered
                                        traffic. These services also provide a pod for running
                                        command-line interface tools (via <code class="ph codeph">kubectl</code>).
                                        Finally, system backup and restore is managed via these
                                        services.</p>
</li>

                        <li class="li">Charging Gateway Function<p class="p">These microservices manage all of the CDRs
                                        in NCC. For more information on the CDRs, see <a class="xref" href="charging_gateway_function.html">NCC Charging Gateway Function (CGF [DR]) and CDRs</a>.</p>
</li>

                        <li class="li">Telemetry<p class="p">NCC Telemetry is an optional component that provides all the
                                        services for logs, alarms, and metrics. For information on
                                        NCC Telemetry, see <a class="xref" href="overview.html">NCC Telemetry components</a>.</p>
