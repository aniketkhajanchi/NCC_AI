            <p class="p">In networks deploying the Independent pairs of ME subsystems model, the operator’s
                network is responsible for routing all incoming traffic to the proper pair of ME
                subsystems. The ME subsystem receiving the incoming message can then determine
                whether it is serving as the current active home for the subscriber or device of
                that message, or whether it needs to forward the message to the other ME subsystem
                in the pair. The index mapping tables used for site routing are limited in scope to
                only the subscribers / devices in that particular ME subsystem pair.</p>

        <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Networked pairs of ME subsystems</h2>
            
            <p class="p">In networks deploying the Networked pairs of ME subsystems model, the operator’s
                network can route incoming messages to any of the ME subsystems. The ME subsystem
                receiving the incoming message can then determine whether it is serving as the
                current active home for the subscriber or device of that message, or whether it
                needs to forward the message to another ME subsystem in the network. In this
                deployment model, every ME subsystem can forward a message to any other ME subsystem
                in the network, not limited to just the other ME subsystem in this pair. This
                simplifies the responsibilities of the operator’s routing.</p>

            <p class="p">An NCC network deployment can have multiple pairs of ME subsystems. Each pair
                contains one data partition and device/group/account data is replicated only within
                that particular pair. Traffic failover always occurs only within that particular
                pair. The global mapping tables on the ME subsystem contain the data for all ME
                subsystems in the entire network, not just for this pair. In this way, a call can
                land on any ME subsystem in any pair and it is correctly routed to the active ME
                subsystem for that device. So, while the device/group/account data is replicated
                only within the single pair of ME subsystems, the global mapping tables are N-way
                replicated between all ME subsystems. With this NCC architecture, there is no need
                for external network routers. This architecture also allows devices to roam between
                regions and have their transactions always routed back to the home ME subsystem,
                regardless of which ME subsystem pair received the transaction from the roaming
                device.</p>

            <p class="p">With networked pairs, similar to independent pairs, the majority of data is
                replicated only within that particular ME subsystem pair. The difference is that
                with networked pairs, the index mapping tables used for site routing to the
                currently active home ME subsystem, is replicated amongst all ME subsystems in the
                network. Thus, if there are six ME subsystems in the network, this index mapping
                data is six-way replicated across all of them. An update by any one of the ME
                subsystems is replicated to all others.</p>
