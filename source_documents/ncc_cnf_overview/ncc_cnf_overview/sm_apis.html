        <p class="p">NCC hosts application programming interfaces (APIs) on its SM subsystem. These APIs are
            typically REST-based and support a variety of users, including:</p>

        <ul class="ul" id="sm_apis__ul_qkf_zbx_nlb">
            <li class="li">
                <p class="p">SM GUI users: The SM GUI implementation invokes the REST APIs to take action on
                    the data submitted through the GUI.</p>

            </li>

            <li class="li">
                <p class="p">IT systems: Customers have a variety of IT systems for configuring, provisioning,
                    and querying data in NCC. These IT systems are users of the NCC APIs provided by
                    the API Gateway on the SM subsystem.</p>

            </li>

            <li class="li">
                <p class="p">Self-care users: The users that might come from mobile applications or web
                    portals.</p>

            </li>

        </ul>

        <p class="p">In all of these use cases, the same REST API layer in the SM application is invoked. This
            layer provides the business logic to authorize the user, validate data change requests
            (including against other data already in the database), index, mediate, and persist
            appropriate portions of the data in the SM database.</p>

        <div class="p">This figure shows the API layer. <div class="fig fignone" id="sm_apis__fig_bmm_5mz_cmb"><span class="figcap"><span class="fig--title-label">Figure: </span>REST API layer</span>
                
                <img class="image imagecenter break" id="sm_apis__image_cmm_5mz_cmb" src="images/cnf_overview_REST-API-layer.GIF" height="322" width="430" />
            </div>
</div>

        <p class="p">When a GUI user requests that a set of service data gets saved, it is saved into the SM
            subsystem database. Later, when the GUI user requests that data be distributed to a set
            of ME subsystems, then the SM subsystem forwards that data to the requested ME
            subsystems in the network.</p>

        <p class="p">Some data remains in the SM subsystem database even after distributing it to the ME
            subsystems, such as service definitions. However, other data, such as subscriber /
            device data, is not kept in the SM subsystem database, but instead, SM keeps only an
            index table of which subscribers and devices are homed on which NCC ME subsystems in the
            network.</p>

        <p class="p">For each service data managed object, the SM subsystem maintains the provisioned state
            for each applicable ME subsystem, in its database. This is used to track the association
            of each object with where the user intends it to be sent, and whether the SM subsystem
            was successful in sending it there. The GUI displays an indication for failed /
            partially distributed objects to alert the user that action needs to be taken to correct
            problems.</p>

        <p class="p">The APIs are accessible only through HTTPS.</p>

        <p class="p">NCC also supports custom APIs provided by Nokia Services as microservices deployed on the
            SM subsystem. These microservices enable operator-specific custom APIs to be offered
            externally, with custom mediation into the standard NCC REST APIs. These custom APIs
            must be contracted through Nokia Services.</p>

        <p class="p">For more information about the NCC REST API interfaces and classes, including examples
            and parameter descriptions, see the NCC Documentation in the Service Manager GUI and
            locate the SM API Reference.</p>
